One such company wants to open a very high end restaurant in the Toronto area, but wants to utilize data to ensure that they choose an area with fewer restaurants to compete with and a large amount of higher income families. By utilizing FourSquare I plan to aid this company in choosing the perfect neighborhood for them to open a new high end restaurant in."
